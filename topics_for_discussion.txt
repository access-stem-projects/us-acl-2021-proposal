Topic 1.  Are we concerned with end-to-end accessibility?
(Topic started by David F)

By end-to-end accessibility I mean that the author indicates the
meaning as they write the original source, and that meaning
is preserved throughout the pipeline to the point where the
final product is consumed (presumably on a Web page) by a reader.
If the reader is using Assistive Technology (AT) to listen to
the page, then expressions like

|g|

will be pronounced correctly.  Note that possible pronunciations
include

absolute value of g
order of g
determinant of g
cardinality of g
length of g


End-to-end accessibility is not the norm now.  Often authors write
the string " |g| "  in the document source.  Volker (and others)
have developed heuristics to help determine the meaning -- and then
use the meaning to give the correct pronunciation.  Given the abysmal
state of LaTeX source, which is well-known to all who spend time
looking at LaTeX from a variety of authors, it is natural to be
skeptical that authors can be persuaded to write better source.


But let's assume we want to pursue end-to-end accessibility.  That
would require an input method which allows authors to indicate
the meaning.  Here are some possibilities.

1. Semantic LaTeX macros.

The author would type \abs{x}, or \order{x} or \det{x} or something
else to indicate the meaning.  All of those typeset as  |x| , but
the source has extra information which conveys the meaning.

LaTeXML is an example:  https://dlmf.nist.gov/LaTeXML/

2. Semantic editing programs.

An interface like the Equation Editor in Word could be enhanced to
prompt the author to disambiguate an expression.

I have heard of people working on this, but don't know of any examples.

3.  Space Math (disclaimer:  this is my idea -DF) (second disclaimer:
what exists at the link below is all there is; there is no implementation.)

4.  What are other possibilities?
